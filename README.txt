# HospitalRegistrationMVC

This is an MVC application built using jsp, servlets and MySQL database(JDBC). 
Functionalities:
login  
Add new patient
view recently registered patients(recent 100 would be displayed in a dynamic table). 
search and update.

jsp is acting as view and servlet as controller and MySql database as my Model. PatientdbUtil.java class in the helper class that communicates with servelt and database.

Future Work:
Update password after every use and send the updated password through email to the user. Add logging functionality.
